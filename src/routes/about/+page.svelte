			I am <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/justinahinon" target="_blank" class="default"
				>Justin Ahinon</a
			>, the founder of OrcheWeb. I have been in the software development industry for over 5 years
			now. During my career, I have worked on a variety of projects, from corporate web development
			to custom app development and integration softwares.
		</p>
		<p>
			For the last three years, I have been deeply involved in the Open Source ecosystem, and
			especially <a
				href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/justinahinon"
				target="_blank"
				class="default">contributed to WordPress full-time for a couple of years</a
			>. During that time, I've many major and minor releases, and contributed a lot the
			documentation, testing, and accessibility for the CMS.
		</p>
		<p>
			I founded OrcheWeb because I've started noticing a pattern in what people have been looking
			for when they hire me as a developer to work on their projects. Things like a fast, responsive
			and performant website, search engine optimizations, third parties integrations (like
			newsletter, contact form, etc...) were regularly part of the base requirements for any project
			I've built as a freelance developer.
		</p>

		<p>
			I've came to create some patterns to satisfy those needs, and at some point, it just made
			sense to turn into a subscription based service.
