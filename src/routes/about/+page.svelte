		<p>
			I am Justin Ahinon, the founder of OrcheWeb. I have been in the software development industry
			for over 5 years now. During my career, I have worked on a variety of projects, from corporate
			web development to custom app development and integration softwares.
		</p>
		<p>
			For the last three years, I have been deeply involved in the Open Source ecosystem, and
			especially <a href="/" class="default"
				>contributed to WordPress full-time for a couple of years</a
			>. During that time, I've many major and minor releases, and contributed a lot the
			documentation, testing, and accessibility for the CMS.
		</p>

		<h2>Starting OrcheWeb</h2>
		<p>
			One thing that haven't changed since I started working at a software engineer, is that I have
			been getting regularly requests from professionals (consultants, coaches) who want to create
			an online presence. This could be a portfolio website, a business marketing website, a blog, a
			custom web app, etc..
		</p>
		<p>
			Over the years, I came to realize that most of my clients wanted these same basic features on
			their sites/app:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A fast, responsive and performant website</li>
			<li>A well-designed and well-structured website</li>
			<li>A website that's optimized for search engines</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Other secondary features might include a newsletter, an integration with third party services
			like a live chat, a contact form, etc..
